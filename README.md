I used a framework from Bootstrap as a template or outline for the updated portfolio. 
I updated the portfolio with recent projects from earlier in the class. 
I added 3 of my best projects to the portfolio 
I added a link to the github repository and the live site of each project 
I then added a downloadable PDF version of my most up to date resume. 
I wanted to add a contact me page, but I did not have the tools to add a database or server this information.
I used a netlify account to add information to my contact me page, but netlify did not pull the CSS properties property. See in the Links below.
